The project titled "Simple Multiplayer Chat Game" focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms for real-time multiplayer communication in gaming environments. The game enables players to interact with each other through a chat interface while participating in a virtual game. The primary goal is to allow users to communicate with fellow players in real time and accumulate points based on their interactions and achievements within the game. The project explores key algorithms for efficient message exchange, server-client communication, and point allocation, ensuring a smooth and engaging multiplayer experience.
